# claude-agent-sdk extension changes

## 2026-07-30 - Terminal pre-execution denial for host-captured tools (#494)

- Added an SDK `PreToolUse` hook for the six native Claude Code tools and `mcp__custom-tools__*`.
- The hook denies before Claude Code permission handling or safe-command execution with a terminal instruction not to retry.
- Senpi still captures the streamed tool call and executes it through its own validation, hook, and permission pipeline.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are the query options and tool denial constants.

## 2026-07-27 - Initial builtin provider

- New builtin extension: Claude Agent SDK provider with native multi-account OAuth, HRW session
  affinity, mandatory stream-safe failover, `/claude-account` + `--claude-account`, RPC/app-server
  account events, and auth guidance. See `packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md` (Claude Agent SDK)
  and `.omo/plans/claude-agent-sdk-oauth-provider.md`.
